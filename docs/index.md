The Australian Computer Assisted Theragnotics (AusCAT) is a federated learning software platform that enables linking of radiation oncology treatment data and outcomes data across hospitals and with state and national registries to allow development of unique models from the combined datasets. Goal of AusCAT is to improve accessibility and governance structures to support data users including clinicians, data scientists, governments and policy makers. AusCAT streamlines data analysis, administrative, ethical, and political aspects of research, enabling learning across datasets that are otherwise difficult to merge due to size or ethical and governance challenges.
