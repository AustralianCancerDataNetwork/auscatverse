# AusCAT Simulation Environment

To enable learning, development and testing of the AusCAT system a simulation environment can be deployed which loads some public data obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive. Within this environment the entire system can be run end-to-end to help prepare for deployment of a production ready system at participating centres/sites.

> CAUTION: The simulation environment deals only with public data. Therefore some default passwords are used to enable quick and easy deployment of the simulation setup. These are not suitable for use in a production system and care should be taken to set secure passwords on a production environment.
